	<h1>Semester Project Creative Brief</h1>
	<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>Artists are finding difficulty in finding geniune reference pictures that aren't machine generated images. Additionally there is no good website that allows for specific objects or references to be searched. This has consequences as Professional artists often rely on reference when creating work for movies, shows, and games.</p>
	<h2>The Audience</h2>
		<p>Artists and other creatives who need specific reference images.</p>
	<h2>The Competition</h2>
		<p>Websites like Pinterest, google images, and Huaban.</p>
	<h2>Key Messages</h2>
		<p>The modern day internet has a surplus in images, that makes it hard for artists to find accurate and useful reference images. This is why our mission is to provide an organized, AI-free, and information-accurate space for artists. We want to create a website that can be a trust worthy spot for research and professional work. Without this website movies, shows, and games will continue to feature inaccuracies.</p>
	<h2>Call to Action</h2>
		<p>When our target audience sees our campaign they will feel inclined to invest and use it.</p>
	<h2>How to Measure Success</h2>
		<p>We will measure success based on the amount of users on the website and accurate image organization.</p>
