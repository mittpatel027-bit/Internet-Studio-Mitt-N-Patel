    <h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>
    <h2>Interview with Farah Ma</h2>
    <h3>Internet Studio Week 6</h3>

    <p>
        The Six Thinking Hats method encourages looking at a problem from multiple perspectives. Each "hat" represents a distinct thinking style: 
        White (facts), Red (emotions), Black (caution), Yellow (optimism), Green (creativity), and Blue (management). 
        This method helps structure discussions, reduce conflict, and explore solutions in a well-rounded way.

    <p>
        My natural thinking style is most aligned with the <strong>Green Hat</strong>, which focuses on creativity thinking. 
        This approach allows me to create ideas and strategies that are unique and abstract.

     <h2>The Interview</h2>
     <p>So in the discussion with my friend they really love the idea of making a website helping residents know the rules and policies at Northside so they can see and are not always coming into our office confused and complaining to us. My friend said based upon the my project it has all good characteristics it has great information that not only residents that live here, but also its a great tool for visitors and fututre prospects who possibly want to lease with us. My project appeals to the emotions of residents who get annoyed because they do not know certain policies that we have here at Northside. My friend say that this project may not work because they think that my idea has already been done and that there are other useful resources like Google already out there. This idea may work because many other residents including myself have gotten lost trying to figure out the polices and proceedures. My friend said that there are so many possibilities for this website that it can be developed into an app for IOS and Andriod. My friend feels the next step for this particular project of mine is to research whats already out there and make improvements and use those improvements for my own website.</p>


     <h3>Changes made to my Project</h3>
     <p>My project has changed because I initially wanted to make a website with policies and rules at Northside. However, I want to create a website that utilizes A.I so that residents can just type what rules they are not certain about.</p>
