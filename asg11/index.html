  <h1>Dodgeball Dream Team</h1>
  <div class="gallery">
    
    <div class="team">
    <img src="images/Sabrina_Carpenter.jpg">
      <h2>Sabrina Sabrina_Carpenter</h2>
      <p>
		She may be short and sweet but that doesn't stop her from being hard and fast. Sabrina will be able to distract other teams with her singing 
		and then strike ferociously. 
	  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="team">
     <img src="images/killua.png">
      <h2>Killua</h2>
      <p>
		Killua has the abillity to conjure eletricity and adapt to it's speed. Meaning he'll be able to catch dodgeballs effeciently and quickly. 
	  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="team">
      <img src="images/superman.jpg">
      <h2>Superman</h2>
      <p>
		Superman has a multitude of abillities in his aresenal. From flight, laser eyes, heat vision, super stregnth, and cold breath. He would be
		an unstoppable force on the field. 
	  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="team">
       <img src="images/sonic.jpg">
      <h2>Sonic</h2>
      <p>
		Sonic just like Killua is extremely fast. Howeever he is so fast that He is able to circumnavigate the Earth within seconds. His lethal speed
		would be a major asset on the court.
	  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="team">
      <img src="images/tallgirl.jpg">
      <h2>Tall Girl</h2>
      <p>
		As the majority of the team are quite short and small in stature I decided it would be best to have someone besides Superman be able to focus on
		the airspace of the court. This is why I am choosing Tall Girl as she will be able to deal with air balls effeciently.
