		<h2>About The Lorax</h2>
			<img src="https://bustedhalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/THE-LORAX-325x216.jpg" alt="The Lorax">
		<P>
		The Lorax is a fictional character created by Dr. Seuss, known for his role as the passionate guardian of the environment in the 1971 book The Lorax. 
		Small, orange, and mustachioed, the Lorax speaks for the trees and other natural elements that cannot defend themselves.
		 He confronts the Once-ler, a figure of unchecked industrialization, warning against the consequences of exploiting nature for profit. 
		 Despite his efforts, the forest is destroyed—but the Lorax leaves behind a message of hope and responsibility:
		  “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.” His character embodies ecological stewardship and moral courage.
		</P>
		<p>
		The Lorax should be president in 2029 because he represents principled leadership rooted in environmental stewardship and moral courage.
		 He speaks for the trees and all living things that cannot speak for themselves, challenging industries and individuals to act responsibly.
		  His presidency would prioritize clean air, renewable energy, and long-term sustainability. 
		  He would inspire citizens to care deeply about their communities and future generations. 
		  With the Lorax in office, justice for the planet would become a national priority.
