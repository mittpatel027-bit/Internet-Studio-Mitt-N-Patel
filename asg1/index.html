	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>What I Learned</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>The web initially started as “read-only.” During the first stage of the World Wide Web, known as “Web 1.0,” the internet 
			only had the capability to send text emails. </li>
		<li> The next generation of the web is known as “Web 3.0”, which will feature machine-to-machine interaction. It’s predicted 
			that data will no longer be owned and instead will be shared repeatedly among multiple machines to create a sort of 
			human-like artificial intelligence. </li>
		<li>The decline of personal websites due to centralized social media, with the additional development of Web 3.0, calls for
			 an increase in thoughtful creation. Reliance on third-party frameworks will decrease as these applications come with 
			 performance and environmental costs. </li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Semester Project</h2>
	<p>I want to create a website that aids artists in finding pieces that include specific items or settings. Similar to Pinterest, 
		but specifically only for visual art made by human hands. As an artist myself, I believe a website like this needs to exist 
		as the practice of master studies is slowly becoming more difficult with the increase of machine-generated images. Additionally, 
		I think one of the best ways to learn how to draw is by observing how other artists draw.</p>
