	<h2>Discussion with Classmate</h2>
	<p>While talking to my friend she thought that I definetly include a shortened version of "reference" within the domain name. 
		As reference images are at the center of my website's purpose. Additionally we both agreed that the domain name had to clearly
		relate to the audience of the website. She suggested I include words like paint or draw, to create a connection to artists who will use the site.
	</p>
	<h3>Best Domain Name</h3>
	<p>The name we liked best was RefStack, as it felt like it was most accurate to both the function and organization of the website. I plan one using
		Pinterest's system of "Boards" and I think "Stack" is a similar feeling to it. Additionally the name includes a shorting of reference, which
		is significant to the usage of the website.
