	<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
	<h2>Conversation With Robots Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</li>
        <li>How do they work together?</li>
        <li>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Structured content and semantic HTML differ in how structured content refers to organizing information into usable commponents. 
    Whilst semantic HTML uses meaningful tags like article to convey the role and hierarchy of each content element within a webpage. When used together structured
    content provides raw data while semantic HTML makes sure that the data is organized in a way that machines can understand it. It's important to utilize
    both semantic and structured content because it enhances accesibillity and enables efficiency. </p>

    <h2>Required Readings Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</li>
        <li>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</li>
        <li>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Among Denise Jacob's methods, for me reframing negative self talk through mindfulness and self compassion would be most effective. This approach helps me shift the internal judgment to curosity and allows space for creativity.
         This is significant as I work as a an artist and often need creativity to stand out.</p><br>
    <p>Hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones—even when waiting would yield a better outcome. It explains why we procrastinate or make impulsive decisions that sabotage long-term goals.
    One method McRaney identifies to counteract this is precommitment setting up systems or decisions in advance that lock in future behavior, like scheduling automatic savings or using productivity apps that block distractions. For me, precommitment 
    would work best because it aligns with my preference for structured, step-by-step planning.</p><br>
    <p>As a creator and publisher learning web fundamentals, I’m beginning to tap into network-making power by choosing what content to publish, how to structure it, and which platforms to use. While I may not yet control large-scale networks, 
        I do have the power to design inclusive, accessible, and authentic content that can influence how others interact with my work.
